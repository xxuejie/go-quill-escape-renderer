# go-quill-escape-renderer

Terminal escape code renderer to QuillJS format, with possible extensions. One example is `ESC U` followed by image data in [data URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) directly. This allows a much simpler solution for generating images than [SIXEL](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel).
